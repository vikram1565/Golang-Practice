# **Pointers**

## *What is pointer arithmetics. Does go support it*

Pointer or Address arithmetics is a method of calculating the address of an object with the help of arithmetic operations on pointers and use of pointers in comparison operations.
ex. if ptr is a pointer to int, a ptr++ operation will point to next int address.

Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.
